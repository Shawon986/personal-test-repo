		<p style="color:black;text-align:justify">Bangladesh, country of South Asia, located in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent.BangladeshThe riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion of the historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, along with what is now the Indian state of West Bengal, the province of Bengal in British India. With the partition of India in 1947, it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan), one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory. In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka. </p>

		<h4 style="color:orange"> <u><i> People:</i> </u></h4>
		<p style="color:black;text-align:justify"> Bangladesh is the world's eight most populous nation, with about 160 million to 170 million people, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with 1,260 people per square kilometer (3,315 people per square mile). There were 128,095,000 people in Bangladesh in 1995, and the population density at that time was 836 people per square kilometers (2,236 people per square mile). About 38.2 percent of all Bangladeshis lives in urban areas — double the figure of the mid 1990s — and most of the remaining people live in small agricultural villages in rural rice-growing area. Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, has grown enormously in recent decades to become a "megacity". The greater Dhaka area is home to over 18 million, about 15 percent of Bangladesh’s population.Great strides have been made in family planning and now the population is only growing at the rate of about one percent a year as women are having an average of two children, compared 6.8 per woman in 1965 to around 3 per woman in 1999. The average life expectancy 72.3 years, compared to 56 years in the 1990s. About 26.5 percent of all Bangladeshis are under 15. About 6.8 percent are over 65.The people of Bangladesh are called Bangladeshis. The majority of them are Bengalis (Bangalis or Bangalees), which are defined as speakers of the Bengali (Bangla) language. They live in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, which is divided between India and Bangladesh. Bengalis can also be found in Calcutta and eastern India. They make up 98 percent of the population of Bangladesh.Other groups found in Bangladesh include the Bihari and a million members of tribal groups that live in the eastern frontier regions near Mynamar and Assam (India) and hilly regions of Sylhet, Mymenshingh, Rangmati, Khagrachari and Bandarban..</p>
